# yc-speculation

After spending too much time on Reddit looking at the S24 thread, I found a lot of users speculating that they could see the change in application status in the front end code when they were logged into their account. This is the beginning code to create a chrome extension for getting alerts when the given parameters change. It could very likely be applied to other types of applications where large internet communities overanalyze admissions portals such as job applications, college admissions, etc. Don't violate your target application site policies, but have fun with it.

Here are the variables speculated on the YC front end: stage: 'done_voting' && result 'undecided' == interview
stage: 'done_voting' && result 'decided' && no interview request == rejection
stage: 'in_voting' && result 'undecided' == still deciding on the application
